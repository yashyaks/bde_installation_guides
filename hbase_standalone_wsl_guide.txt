Prerequisites 
=============================
WSL
Java
(Refer Hadoop guide if both are not installed)

Prerequisite Test

sudo apt update
java -version
javac -version
if not: 
	sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

Downloading HBase
===============================
# If wget doesn't connect i.e. doesn't show 'Connecting to dlcdn.apache.org (dlcdn.apache.org)|151.101.2.132|:443... connected.' 
# or shows 'HTTP request sent, awaiting response...' but doesn't show a progress bar of download press 'ctrl + c' and enter cmd again

wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/hbase/2.5.8/hbase-2.5.8-hadoop3-bin.tar.gz

# A standalone instance has all HBase daemons — the Master, RegionServers, and ZooKeeper — running in a single JVM persisting to the local filesystem.
# In standalone mode HBase runs all daemons within this single JVM, i.e. the HMaster, a single HRegionServer, and the ZooKeeper daemon
# It is the most basic deploy profile.

Extract the downloaded file, and change to the newly-created directory.
===============================
tar xzf hbase-2.5.8-hadoop3-bin.tar.gz
cd hbase-2.5.8-hadoop3/

Change the following files
===============================
nano conf/hbase-env.sh

# Add below line after the line in the file '# The java implementation to use.  Java 1.8+ required.'

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64

Launching HBase
===============================

# To open HBase Web UI.
./bin/start-hbase.sh 
# Open http://localhost:16010/ in your browser (installed on windows or wsl)
# It should display the HBase Web UI.

# You can use the jps command to verify that you have one running process called HMaster
jps 
# expected output (numbers can vary)
691 HMaster
2005 Jps

# To open the Hbase Shell
./bin/hbase shell

# expected output (numbers can vary)
